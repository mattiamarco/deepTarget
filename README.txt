This work is a revision of the deepTarget model developed by Lee, Byunghan in the paper ‘Deep Learning-Based microRNA Target Prediction Using Experimental Negative Data’.


The full GitHub repository is available here: https://github.com/ailab-seoultech/deepTarget.


The ‘deepTarget_project’ Jupyter notebook does not need any setup. In this repository I provide the same dataset form the original paper.
